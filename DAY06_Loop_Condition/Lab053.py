# for loop is used for iterating over a sequence
# (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string)


for x in "banana":  # iterative each word from string banana
    print(x)

# The range() Function
# To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,
# The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default,
# and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

for x in range(2,10,2): # 2 - starting value, 10-range, 2 - increment by what value
    print(x)
