# Tuples: It is exactly the same as list except it is immutable
# i.e once we create tuples, we cant perform any changes in objects
# parenthesis are optional but recorded to use

t = 10,20, 30,40, 50 # 0r (10,20,30,40,50)
print(t)

t= (10)
print(t)

t= (10,)
print(t)

# Note - we have to take special care about single value tuples; compulsory values should be ended with comma,
# otherwise treated as not a tuples
